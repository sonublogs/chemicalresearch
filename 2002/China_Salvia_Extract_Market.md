 <p>China&#39;s Salvia Extract market is growing steadily, driven by increasing demand for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and natural health products. In 2023, China produced approximately 8,500 metric tons of salvia extract, with 65% consumed domestically and 35% exported. The pharmaceutical sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 55% of demand, followed by nutraceuticals at 30% and cosmetics at 15%. The market benefited from growing recognition of TCM globally, which led to a 20% increase in salvia extract exports in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on improving extraction efficiency and standardization, with new processes achieving 30% higher bioactive compound yields compared to 2020 methods. The market is seeing strong growth in water-soluble salvia extracts, increasing at 12% annually, driven by demands for easy-to-formulate ingredients in functional beverages. In 2023, new regulations on herbal medicine quality led to a 25% increase in the adoption of HPLC-standardized salvia extracts. The industry faces challenges from wild resource depletion, but investments in large-scale salvia cultivation are ensuring sustainable supply. Emerging applications in anti-aging skincare products are showing promise, with salvia-based cosmeceuticals growing at 18% <strong>CAGR</strong>, albeit from a small base of 4% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from ongoing research into salvia&#39;s neuroprotective properties, with extracts for cognitive health supplements projected to grow at 15% <strong>CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p>
