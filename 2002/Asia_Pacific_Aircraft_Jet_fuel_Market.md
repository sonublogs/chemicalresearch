<h1>Asia Pacific Aircraft Jet fuel Market Research Report 2024-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>The Asia Pacific Aircraft Jet Fuel market size was valued at US$ 62.37 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 89.15 billion by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 6.1% during the forecast period 2024-2030.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Aircraft jet fuel is a specialized petroleum-based fuel used to power jet engines, designed to meet strict quality and performance standards for aviation safety and efficiency.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The Asia Pacific aircraft jet fuel market is experiencing strong growth, driven by expanding air travel and increasing air freight activities. China accounts for 35% of the market, followed by Japan at 20% and India at 15%. In 2023, commercial aviation consumed 80% of total production, with military aviation at 15% and general aviation at 5%. The market saw an 8% increase in demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) due to growing environmental concerns. <strong>Key players</strong> include Sinopec Group (China) and Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (India), collectively holding a 40% market share in the region. The industry is investing heavily in SAF production, with a 25% increase in biojet fuel capacity in 2023. Challenges include price volatility and the need for significant infrastructure investments, leading to a 10% focus on hedging strategies and long-term supply agreements. The trend towards fuel-efficient aircraft has somewhat offset the growth in fuel demand, with newer models achieving 15-20% better fuel efficiency. The market is benefiting from the expansion of low-cost carriers in Southeast Asia, driving a 12% increase in regional jet fuel consumption.</p>
