<h1>China Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Product Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>The China Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Product market size was valued at US$ 28.45 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 39.67 billion by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.7% during the forecast period 2024-2030.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Products encompass a wide range of items made from PET resin, including bottles, containers, films, fibers, and engineering plastics, known for their strength, transparency, and recyclability.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>China&#39;s PET Product market is growing steadily, driven by increasing consumption across packaging, textile, and industrial sectors. In 2023, China consumed approximately 25.3 million metric tons of PET for various product applications, with 82% produced domestically and 18% imported. The packaging sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 46% of demand, followed by textiles at 34% and industrial applications at 20%. The market benefited from the rapid growth of e-commerce and food delivery services, which led to a 23% increase in demand for PET packaging in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on improving PET properties and processing efficiency, with new grades offering 32% faster molding cycles compared to 2020 standards. The market is witnessing strong growth in recycled PET products, increasing at 15% annually, driven by sustainability initiatives and government regulations. In 2023, new plastic waste reduction policies led to a 28% increase in PET bottle collection rates for recycling. The industry faces challenges from environmental concerns over plastic waste, but investments in chemical recycling technologies are opening new pathways for PET circularity. Emerging applications in 3D printing filaments and technical textiles are showing promise, with high-performance PET materials growing at 18% <strong>CAGR</strong>, albeit from a small base of 2% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from innovations in barrier technologies, with PET products for oxygen-sensitive applications projected to grow at 9% <strong>CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p>
