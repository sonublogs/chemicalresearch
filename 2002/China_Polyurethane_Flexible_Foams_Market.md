<h1>China Polyurethane Flexible Foams Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>The China Polyurethane Flexible Foams market size was valued at US$ 7.23 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 10.15 billion by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.8% during the forecast period 2024-2030.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Polyurethane Flexible Foams are versatile materials known for their comfort, durability, and energy absorption properties, widely used in furniture, bedding, automotive seating, and various consumer products.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>China&#39;s Polyurethane Flexible Foams market is experiencing steady growth, driven by increasing urbanization and rising living standards. In 2023, China produced approximately 3.8 million metric tons of flexible polyurethane foam, with 90% consumed domestically and 10% exported. The furniture and bedding sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 55% of demand, followed by automotive at 25% and consumer goods at 15%. The market saw a significant boost from China&#39;s booming e-commerce furniture sales, which led to a 20% increase in demand for foam mattresses in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on developing low-emission foams, with new formulations reducing VOC emissions by 40% compared to 2020 standards. The market is witnessing strong growth in high-resilience foams, increasing at 8% annually, driven by demands for improved durability in automotive seating. In 2023, new regulations on flame retardancy in public spaces led to a 15% increase in the use of fire-resistant flexible foams in transportation and hospitality sectors. The industry faces challenges from raw material price fluctuations, particularly for TDI and polyols, but innovations in bio-based feedstocks are helping to stabilize costs and improve sustainability. Emerging applications in wearable technology are showing promise, with flexible foams for smart textiles growing at 25% <strong>CAGR</strong>, albeit from a small base of 1% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from China&#39;s aging population, with specialized medical foams for healthcare applications projected to grow at 10% <strong>CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p>
