<h1>China Flame Retardant PBT Granules Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>The China Flame Retardant PBT Granules market size was valued at US$ 854.6 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 1.23 billion by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 6.2% during the forecast period 2024-2030.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Flame Retardant PBT Granules are polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) materials enhanced with flame retardant additives, offering a combination of fire resistance, good mechanical properties, and electrical insulation characteristics for various high-performance applications.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>China&#39;s Flame Retardant PBT Granules market is experiencing steady growth, driven by increasing demand in electrical & electronics, automotive, and industrial sectors. In 2023, China produced approximately 420,000 metric tons of flame retardant PBT granules, with 75% consumed domestically and 25% exported. The electrical & electronics sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 50% of demand, followed by automotive at 30% and industrial applications at 15%. The market saw a significant boost from China&#39;s rapid development in electric vehicle production, which led to a 28% increase in demand for flame retardant PBT in EV charging systems and battery components in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on developing halogen-free flame retardant systems for PBT, with new formulations achieving UL 94 V-0 ratings at lower loadings, improving mechanical and electrical properties. The market is witnessing strong growth in glass fiber reinforced flame retardant PBT, increasing at 9% annually, driven by its superior dimensional stability and electrical properties in high-temperature environments. In 2023, new regulations on fire safety in consumer electronics led to a 20% increase in the use of flame retardant PBT in small appliances and power tools. The industry faces challenges from raw material price fluctuations, but the growing emphasis on miniaturization and high-performance materials in electronics continues to drive demand. Emerging applications in 5G infrastructure components are showing promise, growing at 18% <strong>CAGR</strong>, albeit from a small base of 3% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from the increasing adoption of smart home devices, with flame retardant PBT for IoT device housings and connectors projected to grow at 12% <strong>CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p>
