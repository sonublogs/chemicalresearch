<h1>China Glass Based Laminates (SRBG) Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>The China Glass Based Laminates (SRBG) market size was valued at US$ 568.2 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 782.4 million by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.5% during the forecast period 2024-2030.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Glass Based Laminates (SRBG - Silicone Resin Bonded Glass) are high-performance composite materials made by impregnating glass fabric with silicone resin, offering superior electrical insulation, mechanical strength, and thermal stability for demanding industrial applications.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>China&#39;s Glass Based Laminates (SRBG) market is growing steadily, driven by increasing demand in high-voltage electrical equipment, aerospace, and advanced manufacturing sectors. In 2023, China produced 160,000 metric tons of SRBG laminates, with 75% consumed domestically and 25% exported. The power transmission and distribution sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 60% of demand, followed by aerospace at 20% and industrial machinery at 15%. The market saw a significant boost from China&#39;s investments in ultra-high voltage (UHV) transmission projects, which led to a 22% increase in demand for high-performance insulation materials in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on enhancing the dielectric properties and thermal conductivity of SRBG, with new formulations achieving a 30% improvement in heat dissipation compared to 2020 standards. The market is witnessing strong growth in thin SRBG laminates for flexible printed circuits, increasing at 8% annually, driven by the demand for lightweight materials in portable electronics. In 2023, new safety regulations for electrical equipment in hazardous environments led to a 35% increase in adoption of flame-retardant SRBG in oil and gas applications. The industry faces challenges from the high cost of high-purity glass fabrics, but innovations in glass fiber manufacturing are gradually reducing production costs. Emerging applications in 5G infrastructure are showing promise, with specialized SRBG laminates for high-frequency antenna substrates growing at 18% <strong>CAGR</strong>, albeit from a small base of 3% market share. Looking forward, the market is expected to benefit from the growing electric vehicle industry, with SRBG components for EV charging infrastructure projected to grow at 15% <strong>CAGR</strong> through 2030. The development of nano-filled SRBG for enhanced thermal management is also gaining traction, with these advanced materials seeing a 50% increase in R&D investments in 2023.</p>
