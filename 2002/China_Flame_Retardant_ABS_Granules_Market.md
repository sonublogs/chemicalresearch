<h1>China Flame Retardant ABS Granules Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>The China Flame Retardant ABS Granules market size was valued at US$ 2.13 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 3.08 billion by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 6.4% during the forecast period 2024-2030.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Flame Retardant ABS Granules are acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) materials modified with flame retardant additives to enhance fire resistance while maintaining the desirable properties of ABS such as impact strength and processability.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>China&#39;s Flame Retardant ABS Granules market is growing robustly, driven by increasing demand in electronics, automotive, and construction sectors. In 2023, China produced approximately 1.8 million metric tons of flame retardant ABS granules, with 70% consumed domestically and 30% exported. The electronics industry remains the largest consumer, accounting for 45% of demand, followed by automotive at 25% and construction at 20%. The market benefited significantly from China&#39;s dominant position in consumer electronics manufacturing, which led to a 22% increase in demand for flame retardant ABS in smartphone and laptop casings in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on developing eco-friendly flame retardant systems, with new phosphorus-based formulations reducing bromine content by 50% while maintaining UL 94 V-0 ratings. The market is seeing strong growth in high-heat resistant flame retardant ABS, increasing at 10% annually, driven by demands in automotive under-the-hood applications. In 2023, new regulations on fire safety in public buildings led to a 28% increase in the use of flame retardant ABS in electrical fixtures and fittings. The industry faces challenges from the higher cost compared to standard ABS, but innovations in synergistic flame retardant systems are helping to reduce overall additive loadings and improve cost-effectiveness. Emerging applications in 3D printing of functional prototypes are showing promise, growing at 25% <strong>CAGR</strong>, albeit from a small base of 2% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from the rapid expansion of 5G infrastructure, with flame retardant ABS for base station components projected to grow at 15% <strong>CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p>
