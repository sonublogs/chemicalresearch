<h1>China EPDM and SBR Granules Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>The China EPDM and SBR Granules market size was valued at US$ 587.3 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 821.6 million by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.8% during the forecast period 2024-2030.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) and SBR (Styrene Butadiene Rubber) Granules are synthetic rubber materials used in various applications, particularly in sports surfaces, playgrounds, and construction, offering excellent weather resistance, shock absorption, and durability.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>China&#39;s EPDM and SBR Granules market is experiencing steady growth, driven by increasing investments in sports infrastructure and urban development. In 2023, China produced 562,000 metric tons of combined EPDM and SBR granules, with 82% consumed domestically and 18% exported. The sports surfacing sector remains the primary consumer, accounting for 48% of demand, followed by playground safety surfaces at 27%, and construction applications at 18%. The market is benefiting from the government&#39;s initiative to promote sports participation, which drove a 16% increase in new sports facility construction in 2023. Technological advancements focus on enhancing durability and environmental performance, with new EPDM formulations offering 35% longer lifespan compared to 2020 standards. The market is seeing a shift towards blended EPDM/SBR systems, growing at 8.5% annually due to their optimized performance-to-cost ratio. In 2023, the Ministry of Education implemented new safety guidelines for school playgrounds, leading to a 23% increase in demand for fall-protection surfacing using these materials. The market faces challenges from raw material price fluctuations, with EPDM prices experiencing volatility of up to 15% in 2023. Research into heat-reflective EPDM granules is emerging as a promising field, with applications in urban heat island mitigation growing at 19% <strong>CAGR</strong>, albeit from a small base of 2% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from the increasing focus on sustainable urban development, with recycled content granules projected to grow at 13% <strong>CAGR</strong> through 2030, reaching an estimated 15% market share by 2030. The development of smart surfaces integrating EPDM/SBR granules with sensor technologies for sports performance analysis is also gaining traction, with R&D investments in this area increasing by 28% in 2023 compared to the previous year.</p>
