<h1>China Crystalline Dextrose Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>The China Crystalline Dextrose market size was valued at US$ 723.5 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 965.2 million by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.9% during the forecast period 2024-2030.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Crystalline Dextrose, also known as glucose, is a simple sugar derived from corn or wheat starch, widely used in food and beverage, pharmaceutical, and personal care industries as a sweetener, energy source, and fermentation substrate.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>China&#39;s Crystalline Dextrose market is growing steadily, driven by increasing demand in the food processing and pharmaceutical sectors. In 2023, China produced approximately 2.1 million metric tons of crystalline dextrose, with 75% consumed domestically and 25% exported. The food and beverage industry remains the largest consumer, accounting for 60% of demand, followed by pharmaceuticals at 25% and personal care products at 10%. The market benefited from the rapid growth of the functional food and sports nutrition segments, which led to a 15% increase in demand for dextrose as an energy supplement in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on improving purity levels and production efficiency, with leading manufacturers achieving 99.9% purity while reducing energy consumption by 20% compared to 2020 processes. The market is seeing strong growth in non-GMO dextrose, increasing at 8% annually, driven by consumer preferences for clean label products. In 2023, new regulations on sugar reduction in processed foods led to a 12% increase in the use of dextrose as a low-calorie bulking agent. The industry faces challenges from fluctuating corn prices, but innovations in enzyme technology are helping to improve conversion rates and stabilize production costs. Emerging applications in biodegradable plastics are showing promise, with dextrose-based polymers growing at 20% <strong>CAGR</strong>, albeit from a small base of 2% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from the expanding nutraceutical industry in China, with specialized dextrose formulations for medical nutrition projected to grow at 10% <strong>CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p>
