<h1>China Polyether Polyols for Polyurethane Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>The China Polyether Polyols for Polyurethane market size was valued at US$ 6.78 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 9.45 billion by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.7% during the forecast period 2024-2030.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Polyether Polyols for Polyurethane are key components in polyurethane production, reacting with isocyanates to form a wide range of polyurethane products with diverse properties for applications in construction, automotive, furniture, and more.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>China&#39;s Polyether Polyols for Polyurethane market is growing robustly, driven by increasing demand across various end-use industries. In 2023, China produced approximately 4.5 million metric tons of polyether polyols for polyurethane applications, with 80% consumed domestically and 20% exported. The flexible foam sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 55% of demand, followed by rigid foams at 30%, and CASE (Coatings, Adhesives, Sealants, Elastomers) applications at 15%. The market benefited significantly from China&#39;s booming e-commerce sector, which led to a 25% increase in demand for rigid polyurethane foam packaging in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on developing polyols with enhanced reactivity and processability, with new grades offering 20% faster cure times compared to 2020 standards. The market is seeing strong growth in specialty polyols for high-performance coatings, increasing at 10% annually, driven by demands in the automotive refinish and industrial maintenance sectors. In 2023, new energy efficiency regulations led to a 30% increase in the use of polyols for spray foam insulation in building retrofits. The industry faces challenges from environmental concerns regarding traditional polyether polyol production, but innovations in CO2-based and bio-sourced polyols are addressing these issues. Emerging applications in wearable electronics are showing promise, with polyurethane-based flexible electronics growing at 22% <strong>CAGR</strong>, albeit from a small base of 2% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from China&#39;s ambitious infrastructure plans, with polyols for polyurethane concrete raising agents projected to grow at 15% <strong>CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p>
