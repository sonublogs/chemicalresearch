<h1>China Recycled Polyester (rPET) Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>The China Recycled Polyester (rPET) market size was valued at US$ 4.23 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 7.15 billion by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 9.1% during the forecast period 2024-2030.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Recycled Polyester (rPET) is a sustainable alternative to virgin polyester, produced by recycling post-consumer PET products, primarily plastic bottles, into new polyester materials for use in textiles, packaging, and other applications.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>China&#39;s Recycled Polyester (rPET) market is experiencing rapid growth, driven by increasing environmental awareness, government regulations, and corporate sustainability initiatives. In 2023, China produced approximately 5.2 million metric tons of rPET, with 75% consumed domestically and 25% exported. The textile industry remains the largest consumer, accounting for 65% of demand, followed by packaging at 25% and automotive at 10%. The market saw a significant boost from China&#39;s plastic waste reduction policies, which led to a 40% increase in PET bottle recycling rates in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on improving the quality of rPET, with new depolymerization and repolymerization techniques achieving virgin-like properties in 85% of applications. The market is witnessing strong growth in food-grade rPET, increasing at 15% annually, driven by beverage companies&#39; commitments to use recycled content in their packaging. In 2023, major fashion brands&#39; sustainability targets led to a 30% increase in the use of rPET in apparel and footwear. The industry faces challenges from contamination in the recycling stream, but investments in advanced sorting and cleaning technologies are addressing these issues. Emerging applications in 3D printing filaments and technical textiles are showing promise, with high-performance rPET materials growing at 20% <strong>CAGR</strong>, albeit from a small base of 3% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from the development of chemical recycling technologies, with chemically recycled PET projected to grow at 25% <strong>CAGR</strong> through 2030, offering new possibilities for closed-loop recycling.</p>
