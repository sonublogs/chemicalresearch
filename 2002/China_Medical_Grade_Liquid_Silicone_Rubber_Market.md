<h1>China Medical-Grade Liquid Silicone Rubber Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>The China Dibenzoate Plasticizer market size was valued at US$ 218.6 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 295.4 million by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.2% during the forecast period 2024-2030.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Dibenzoate Plasticizers are non-phthalate plasticizers derived from benzoic acid, used to improve flexibility, workability, and durability of polymers, particularly in PVC applications, offering a safer alternative to traditional phthalate plasticizers.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>China&#39;s Dibenzoate Plasticizer market is growing steadily, driven by increasing demand for non-phthalate plasticizers in various industries due to regulatory pressures and health concerns. In 2023, China produced 145,000 metric tons of dibenzoate plasticizers, with 70% consumed domestically and 30% exported. The PVC industry remains the largest consumer, accounting for 65% of demand, followed by adhesives and sealants at 20%, and coatings at 15%. The market is benefiting from the government&#39;s push towards safer plasticizers, which drove a 12% increase in adoption by major PVC manufacturers in 2023. Technological advancements focus on improving compatibility with different polymer systems, with new grades offering 25% better fusion with PVC compared to 2020 formulations. The market is seeing a shift towards bio-based dibenzoate plasticizers, growing at 8% annually due to increasing environmental concerns. In 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment implemented stricter regulations on plasticizer emissions, leading to a 20% increase in demand for low-VOC dibenzoate formulations. The market faces challenges from competition with other non-phthalate plasticizers, but dibenzoates&#39; excellent performance in outdoor applications continues to secure its position. Research into synergistic blends of dibenzoates with other plasticizers is emerging as a promising field, with applications offering improved cost-performance ratios growing at 10% <strong>CAGR</strong>. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from the growing automotive industry in China, with dibenzoate plasticizers for automotive interiors projected to grow at 7.5% <strong>CAGR</strong> through 2030. The development of dibenzoate plasticizers for biodegradable polymers is also gaining traction, with R&D investments in this area increasing by 15% in 2023 compared to the previous year.</p>
