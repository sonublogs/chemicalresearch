 <p>Coated Abrasive Paper consists of a paper backing coated with abrasive materials, used for sanding, polishing, and finishing in woodworking, metalworking, and various industrial applications.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>China&#39;s Coated Abrasive Paper market is growing steadily, driven by the country&#39;s large manufacturing base and construction industry. In 2023, China produced approximately 1.8 billion square meters of coated abrasive paper, with 75% consumed domestically and 25% exported. The woodworking industry remains the largest consumer, accounting for 40% of demand, followed by metalworking at 30% and automotive refinishing at 20%. The market benefited from the recovery of the furniture manufacturing sector, which led to a 15% increase in demand for fine-grit abrasive papers in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on developing longer-lasting and more efficient abrasives, with new products offering 30% longer lifespan compared to 2020 standards. The market is seeing strong growth in waterproof abrasive papers, increasing at 8% annually, driven by demands in automotive and marine applications. In 2023, stricter workplace safety regulations led to a 25% increase in the use of dust-free sanding systems, boosting demand for compatible abrasive papers. The industry faces challenges from competition with non-woven abrasives and digital sanding technologies, but innovations in multi-functional abrasive papers are helping maintain market share. Emerging applications in 3D printing post-processing are showing promise, with specialized abrasive papers for additive manufacturing growing at 20% <strong>CAGR</strong>, albeit from a small base of 2% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from China&#39;s ongoing urbanization and infrastructure development, with abrasive papers for construction and renovation projected to grow at 6% <strong>CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p>
