<h1>China Polyether Polyols for Rigid Foams Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>The China Polyether Polyols for Rigid Foams market size was valued at US$ 2.35 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 3.28 billion by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.7% during the forecast period 2024-2030.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Polyether Polyols for Rigid Foams are specialized polyols designed to produce rigid polyurethane foams with excellent insulation properties, structural strength, and dimensional stability, primarily used in construction, appliances, and refrigeration.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>China&#39;s Polyether Polyols for Rigid Foams market is experiencing strong growth, driven by increasing demand for energy-efficient buildings and appliances. In 2023, China produced approximately 1.6 million metric tons of polyether polyols specifically for rigid foam applications, with 90% consumed domestically and 10% exported. The construction industry remains the largest consumer, accounting for 65% of demand, followed by appliances at 25% and refrigeration at 10%. The market saw a significant boost from China&#39;s stringent building energy codes, which led to a 30% increase in demand for polyurethane insulation in commercial buildings in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on improving the insulation performance of rigid foams, with new polyol formulations achieving R-values 15% higher than 2020 standards at equivalent densities. The market is witnessing strong growth in hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) compatible polyols, increasing at 12% annually, driven by the global phasedown of high-GWP blowing agents. In 2023, new cold chain logistics regulations led to a 20% increase in the use of high-performance rigid foam insulation in refrigerated transport. The industry faces challenges from raw material price fluctuations, but the development of recycled content polyols is helping to stabilize costs and improve sustainability. Emerging applications in prefabricated construction elements are showing promise, with polyols for structural insulated panels growing at 18% <strong>CAGR</strong>, albeit from a small base of 3% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from China&#39;s rapid urbanization, with polyols for spray foam insulation in renovation projects projected to grow at 15% <strong>CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p>
