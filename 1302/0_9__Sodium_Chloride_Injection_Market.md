<h1>0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>The global 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection market focuses on an essential medical product used as an electrolyte supplement. Sodium chloride plays a critical role in maintaining the body???s fluid balance and osmotic pressure, as sodium and chloride ions predominantly exist in extracellular fluid. The concentration of sodium in normal serum ranges from 135 to 145 mmol/L, contributing to 92% of plasma cations and 90% of total osmotic pressure, while chloride concentrations fall between 98 and 106 mmol/L. These ions are regulated by the hypothalamus, posterior pituitary, and kidneys to ensure stability in body fluid volume and osmotic pressure. The standard injection concentration, 0.9%, is widely used in medical settings for hydration and as a carrier for other medications.</p><p><strong>The global 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection market was valued at USD 12,120 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 17,282.75 million by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 5.20% from 2023 to 2030. In North America alone, the market size stood at USD 3,158.13 million in 2023, expected to achieve a? <strong>CAGR</strong>? of 4.46% through 2030. This growth reflects increasing demand across healthcare facilities, driven by expanding applications and the rising incidence of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance disorders.</strong></p><p><strong>Rising Prevalence of Chronic Diseases:</strong>?
