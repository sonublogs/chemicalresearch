<h1>Sodium N-Cocoyl Glycinate Powder Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Sodium N-Cocoyl Glycinate is an amino acid-based surfactant commonly used in personal care products such as cleansers, shampoos, body washes, and facial scrubs. It is derived from natural coconut oil and glycine, an amino acid, making it an effective and mild cleansing agent that also provides skin and hair conditioning properties. Due to its gentle nature, it is suitable for sensitive skin and often used in formulations intended for babies or those with skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis.</p><p>The surfactant works by lowering the surface tension between water and oils, allowing for easier removal of dirt, grease, and other impurities. Besides its cleansing properties, Sodium N-Cocoyl Glycinate is also known for its skin-softening and hydrating effects, making it a versatile ingredient in many cosmetic products.</p><p>This ingredient has gained popularity in the personal care market, particularly due to the increasing consumer preference for natural and sustainable ingredients. As a biodegradable, non-toxic substance, it aligns with the growing demand for eco-friendly and cruelty-free products in the beauty and personal care industry.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285889/global-sodium-ncocoyl-glycinate-powder-forecast-market-2025-2032-758">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285889/global-sodium-ncocoyl-glycinate-powder-forecast-market-2025-2032-758</a></b></div><p>The global market for Sodium N-Cocoyl Glycinate Powder was valued at USD 38.50 million in 2023, with projections indicating it will reach USD 57.51 million by 2030.
