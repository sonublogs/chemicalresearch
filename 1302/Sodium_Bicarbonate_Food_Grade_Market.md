<h1>Sodium Bicarbonate Food Grade Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Sodium Bicarbonate Food Grade, commonly known as baking soda, is a white crystalline powder that is widely used as a leavening agent in the food and beverage industry. It is primarily used as an additive to help dough rise, maintain the texture of baked goods, and regulate acidity in various food products. As a food-grade chemical, sodium bicarbonate must meet certain purity standards to ensure it is safe for consumption. It is a versatile compound and is also used in various other food processes such as in the production of effervescent drinks, as a pH control agent, and for cleaning purposes.</p><p>The global demand for food-grade sodium bicarbonate is largely driven by its wide application across multiple sectors, including bakery products, carbonated beverages, and processed foods. Additionally, it is a key ingredient in many household cleaning products, where its non-toxic nature makes it an ideal alternative to harsher chemicals. Given its broad use, sodium bicarbonate remains an essential ingredient in the global food industry.</p><p><strong>Market Size</strong></p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285938/global-sodium-bicarbonate-food-grade-forecast-market-2025-2032-403">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285938/global-sodium-bicarbonate-food-grade-forecast-market-2025-2032-403</a></b></div><p><strong>The global Sodium Bicarbonate Food Grade market was valued at USD 358.10 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 449.48 million by 2030, reflecting a steady compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 3.30% during the forecast period.</strong>? </p><p>Sodium bicarbonate is a critical ingredient in baking, where it serves as a leavening agent for cakes, bread, cookies, and other baked goods.
