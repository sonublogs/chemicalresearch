<h1>Europe Ammonia-free Phenolic Molding Compound Market, Outlook and Forecast 2025-2030</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Ammonia-free phenolic molding compounds are advanced thermosetting materials formulated without ammonia-based catalysts. Traditional phenolic resins often rely on ammonia catalysts for polymerization, but ammonia-free formulations eliminate this component to improve environmental sustainability, reduce harmful emissions, and enhance workplace safety. These compounds retain key advantages such as high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and flame retardancy, making them highly suitable for industries including automotive, electronics, and electrical components.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">As of 2024, the Europe ammonia-free phenolic molding compound market was valued at approximately USD 198.45 million. Projections suggest a strong growth trajectory, with the market expected to reach USD 285.64 million by 2030, reflecting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 6.24% from 2024 to 2030.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The European Union&#39;s strict industrial emission laws are driving industries toward <strong>low-emission, eco-friendly materials</strong>. Ammonia-free phenolic molding compounds align with these sustainability goals, ensuring regulatory compliance and boosting demand.</span></p>
