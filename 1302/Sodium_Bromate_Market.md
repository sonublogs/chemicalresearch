<h1>Sodium Bromate Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Sodium bromate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula NaBrO??????. It appears as a white crystalline solid that is highly soluble in water. Commercially, sodium bromate is synthesized either by reacting bromine with sodium carbonate or through the electrolytic oxidation of sodium bromide. This compound is recognized for its potent oxidizing properties, making it valuable in various industrial applications. However, due to its oxidizing nature, it poses explosion risks when exposed to prolonged heat or fire. Industrially, sodium bromate is utilized as a brominating agent for aromatic compounds, facilitating the production of chemicals such as nitrobenzene, benzoic acid, and benzaldehyde.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Market Size</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">As of 2024, the global sodium bromate market was valued at approximately USD 345.6 million. Projections indicate that this market will reach around USD 456.7 million by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 4.8% during the forecast period. In the United States, the market was valued at USD 98.4 million in 2024, with expectations to grow to USD 128.9 million by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.6%.a</span></p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285934/global-sodium-bromate-forecast-market-2025-2032-303">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285934/global-sodium-bromate-forecast-market-2025-2032-303</a></b></div><p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Market Dynamics</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px"><em>Drivers:</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Textile Industry Demand:</strong> Sodium bromate's oxidizing properties make it essential in the textile industry, particularly in dyeing processes to achieve vibrant and durable colors.
