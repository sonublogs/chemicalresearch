<h1>Disodium Sulfide Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:13px">Disodium Sulfide (Na2S) is a yellowish, solid flake that has a sulfurous, rotten egg odor. While sodium sulfide can exist as Na2S, its most common form is the hydrated version, Na2S??9H2O. Both forms are highly soluble in water and create strongly alkaline solutions. Sodium sulfide is primarily produced by heating sodium sulfate with coal or hydrogen.</span></p><p>In its hydrated form, sodium sulfide is used across several industries due to its versatility. It is commonly utilized in the production of dyes and colors, in metallurgy, chemical synthesis, mining, and waste management. Particularly, sodium sulfide plays a significant role in the manufacturing of chemicals, including sodium hydrosulfide, and is also used in various ore processing applications. Its ability to effectively treat wastewater, soil, and process sludge is another key application, alongside its use in leather and textile industries.</p><p>The global Disodium Sulfide market encompasses various end-use applications, such as the dye industry, leather industry, and metal smelting industry. With its widespread use, it forms a critical component in several industrial processes, making it a vital product in chemical and manufacturing sectors.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285864/global-disodium-sulfide-forecast-market-2025-2032-811">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285864/global-disodium-sulfide-forecast-market-2025-2032-811</a></b></div><p>The global Disodium Sulfide market was valued at USD 368.40 million in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 456.17 million by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 3.10% during the forecast period.</p><p>This market growth is primarily driven by increasing industrial demand for sodium sulfide in various sectors such as textiles, leather processing, and metal refining.
