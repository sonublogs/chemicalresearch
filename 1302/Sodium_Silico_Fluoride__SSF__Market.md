<h1>Sodium Silico Fluoride (SSF) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Sodium fluorosilicate, commonly referred to as Sodium Silico Fluoride (SSF), is an odorless and tasteless chemical compound with a crystalline structure. It appears as white crystal, crystalline powder, or colorless hexagonal crystals. The compound has a relative density of 2.68 and exhibits moisture absorption properties. While insoluble in alcohol, SSF is soluble in acids and partially in water, decomposing in alkaline solutions to form sodium fluoride and silica. Upon heating to 300??C, it breaks down into sodium fluoride and silicon tetrafluoride. Its primary applications include usage in water fluoridation, ceramics, and as a flux in metallurgy, though caution is required due to its toxicity.</p><p><strong>The global Sodium Silico Fluoride (SSF) market was valued at USD 115 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 155.45 million by 2030, registering a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.40% during the forecast period.</strong></p><p>In North America, the market size was USD 29.97 million in 2023, and it is expected to grow at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 3.77% between 2025 and 2030.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285910/global-sodium-silico-fluoride-forecast-market-2025-2032-749">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285910/global-sodium-silico-fluoride-forecast-market-2025-2032-749</a></b></div><p>The growth is driven by increased demand in industrial applications such as ceramics and water treatment processes.
