<h1>Sodium Hydrosulfite Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Sodium hydrosulfite, also known as sodium dithionite, is a white crystalline powder characterized by a weak sulfurous odor. Its chemical formula is Na??????S??????O??????. This compound is typically produced through the reduction of sodium bisulfite or sulfur dioxide with zinc. It is widely used as a reducing agent in industries such as textile dyeing, printing, and stripping, as well as in bleaching applications for textiles and paper. Due to its versatile chemical properties, sodium hydrosulfite plays a crucial role in various industrial processes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">The global sodium hydrosulfite market was valued at USD 316 million in 2023 and is projected to decline to USD 284.28 million by 2030, registering a negative <strong>CAGR</strong> of -0.01% over the forecast period. The North American market size was estimated at USD 82.34 million in 2023, showing a similar <strong>CAGR</strong> of -0.01% between 2025 and 2030.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">The decline in market value is attributed to factors such as shifting industrial applications, environmental concerns, and the rise of alternative chemicals. However, the compound remains integral to specific sectors, including textiles and pulp & paper, which account for a significant share of its consumption.</span></p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285904/global-sodium-hydrosulfite-forecast-market-2025-2032-552">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285904/global-sodium-hydrosulfite-forecast-market-2025-2032-552</a></b></div><p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Textile Industry Demand</strong>: Sodium hydrosulfite is widely used in textile processing, including dyeing and bleaching.
