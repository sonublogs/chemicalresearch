<h1>Swimming Pool Sodium Dichloroisocyanurate Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:14px">Sodium Dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC or SDIC) is a widely used chemical compound known for its effective disinfectant and biocidal properties. Produced by reacting cyanuric acid with chlorine, NaDCC is a colorless, water-soluble solid. It is a key ingredient in water purification tablets and modern disinfection methods. Its primary application lies in disinfecting swimming pools, drinking water, and surfaces. As a slow-release source of chlorine, NaDCC ensures low-concentration, consistent disinfection over time, making it a preferred choice in combating infectious diseases and routine sterilization.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>The global Swimming Pool Sodium Dichloroisocyanurate market was valued at USD 326.70 million in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 447.58 million by 2030, registering a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.60% during the forecast period.</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:14px">In <strong>North America</strong>, the market was worth <strong>USD 85.13 million in 2023</strong> and is expected to grow at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 3.94%</strong> between 2025 and 2030.
