<h1>Sodium N-Butyl Xanthate Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:14px">Sodium N-Butyl Xanthate (CAS 141-33-3) is a chemical compound that typically appears as a yellow or light yellow powder. It is a highly effective flotation reagent, primarily utilized in the mineral processing industry. The product is known for being a strong collector, meaning it can efficiently bind with various non-ferrous metallic sulfide minerals during the flotation process. This characteristic makes it particularly valuable in the bulk flotation of minerals such as chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and pyrite.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14px">Sodium N-Butyl Xanthate plays a vital role in separating valuable minerals from their ores, especially in copper and zinc ore processing. Under optimal conditions, it also serves in the selective flotation of copper sulfide minerals, enabling their separation from iron sulfide minerals. Additionally, after activation with copper sulfate, it is employed in the flotation of sphalerite (zinc sulfide) ores.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14px">This product's primary function as a flotation agent places it within the broader mining and metallurgical industry, where it is used to enhance the extraction of minerals. Beyond flotation, Sodium N-Butyl Xanthate is also used in the rubber industry, acting as an accelerator for vulcanization, although this is a smaller segment compared to its mineral flotation applications.</span></p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285890/global-sodium-nbutyl-xanthate-forecast-market-2025-2032-712">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/285890/global-sodium-nbutyl-xanthate-forecast-market-2025-2032-712</a></b></div><p><span style="font-size:14px">As of 2023, the global Sodium N-Butyl Xanthate market was valued at approximately USD 86 million. It is expected to experience steady growth, with a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 5.40%, projecting the market size to reach approximately USD 124.27 million by 2030. This growth is primarily driven by the increasing demand for flotation reagents in mineral processing, particularly in regions rich in mineral deposits, as well as growing industrial applications in other sectors like rubber production.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14px">This upward trajectory reflects the expanding mining operations globally, particularly in emerging markets where mineral extraction plays a critical role in economic growth.
