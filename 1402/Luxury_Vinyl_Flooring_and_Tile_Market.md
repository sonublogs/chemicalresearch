Such collaborations enable brands to leverage each other's expertise in production, distribution, and marketing.</p><p>Many manufacturers in the LVT space are committing to sustainability initiatives. <strong>Tarkett</strong>, for instance, has introduced a line of LVT products made from recycled vinyl materials. These products not only contribute to a reduction in waste but also align with growing consumer demand for eco-conscious solutions.</p><p>The <strong>North American market</strong> for luxury vinyl flooring was valued at <strong>USD 3.10 billion</strong> in 2023, with a projected <strong>CAGR</strong> of <strong>8.83%</strong> from 2025 to 2032.
