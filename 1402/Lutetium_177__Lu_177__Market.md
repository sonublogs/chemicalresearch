<h1>Lutetium-177 (Lu-177) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032: Supply and Demand analysis, Regional Analysis and Competitive Analysis</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p><p>Lutetium-177 (Lu-177) is a radioactive isotope of lutetium, a rare-earth metal with the atomic number 71. It has a half-life of approximately 6.6 days and emits beta and gamma radiation. Lutetium-177 is used in nuclear medicine for the treatment of various cancers, such as neuroendocrine tumors, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. It is often combined with other radionuclides or chelating agents to form radiolabeled tracers for imaging or therapeutic purposes. Targeted cancer therapy: Lu-177 can be used to treat somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. It achieves targeted therapy of tumors by binding to somatostatin receptors on the tumor surface. Prostate cancer treatment: Lu-177 can combine with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) to form Lu-177 PSMA, which is used to treat advanced prostate cancer. This treatment shrinks or kills tumor cells and relieves pain and other clinical manifestations of metastatic prostate cancer. Neuroendocrine tumor treatment: Neuroendocrine tumors express somatostatin receptors, so Lu-177 can bind to these receptors to achieve targeted therapy of tumors. Compared with traditional cancer treatments, Lu-177 treatment reduces hospital stay, does not affect healthy tissue, and is safe and well-tolerated.</p><p>The global Lutetium-177 (Lu-177) market size was estimated at USD 1564 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 6376.28 million by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 16.90% during the forecast period.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/283863/global-regional-lutetium-forecast-supply-dem-analysis-competitive-market-2025-2032-359">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/283863/global-regional-lutetium-forecast-supply-dem-analysis-competitive-market-2025-2032-359</a></b></div><p>North America Lutetium-177 (Lu-177) market size was estimated at USD 534.15 million in 2023, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 14.49% during the forecast period of 2025 through 2032.</p><p>This report provides a deep insight into the global Lutetium-177 (Lu-177) market covering all its essential aspects.
