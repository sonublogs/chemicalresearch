Because of the low Reid vapor pressure, it is preferred to natural gasoline in ethanol or gasoline mixes. Raffinate is majorly used to synthesize Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), which is a flammable substance. MTBE raises the octane and oxygen content of gasoline and works as a pollution-reducing compound in gasoline. Moreover, raffinate also finds application to synthesize Secondary butyl alcohol (SBA), a coupling agent in water-reducible coatings, industrial cleaners, and paint removers.</p><p><strong>This report aims to provide a comprehensive presentation of the global market for C4 Raffinate, with both quantitative and qualitative analysis, to help readers develop business/growth strategies, assess the market competitive situation, analyze their position in the current marketplace, and make informed business decisions regarding C4 Raffinate.
