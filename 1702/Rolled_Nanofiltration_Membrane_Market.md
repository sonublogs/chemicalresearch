<h1>Rolled Nanofiltration Membrane Market Research Report 2025,Global Forecast to 2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Nanofiltration Membrane is a membrane used in nanofiltration. Nanofiltration functions similarly to reverse osmosis but is generally targeted to remove only divalent and larger ions. Monovalent ions such as sodium and chloride will pass through a nanofiltration membrane, therefore many of its uses involve de-salting of the process stream. The diameter of micropores is generally from 1nm to 2nm. This report mainly focues on rolled nanofiltration membrane market.</p>
