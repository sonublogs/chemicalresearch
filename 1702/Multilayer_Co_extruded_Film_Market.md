 <p>Multilayer Co-Extruded Film refers to a functional composite film produced by extruding the melts of resins with higher barrier properties and other resins through a common die using multiple extruders. Multilayer Co-Extruded Film mostly adopts ABCBA5 layer symmetrical structure, with PA or EVOH as the barrier layer, and polyethylene as the heat-sealing layer. Adhesive resins are used to space the disconnected barrier and heat seal layers. PA or EVOH is a resin that is extremely sensitive to humidity, protected by a polyethylene layer, and its excellent oxygen barrier properties are fully exerted. In general, the structure of a multilayer coextruded film depends on the functional requirements of the film. On the premise of meeting the process requirements, through the combination of different polymers, it can meet the functional requirements of packaging materials such as barrier, heat sealing, body strength, thermal puncture, environmental resistance, secondary processing characteristics, extended storage, and shelf life. From the analysis of functional requirements, the combination formed by five polymers is sufficient. Seven-layer, nine-layer, eleven-layer, and even more Co-Extruded composite films have been used in the market, making it a trend, and developing rapidly. The structural design of the Co-Extruded film is gradually required to systematically achieve the ideal state of integrating function, technology, cost, environmental protection, safety, and secondary processing.</p>
