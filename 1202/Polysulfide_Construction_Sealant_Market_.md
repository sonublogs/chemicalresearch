<h1>Polysulfide Construction Sealant Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:13px">Polysulfide construction sealant is a synthetic rubber-based sealant widely recognized for its superior adhesive characteristics, flexibility, and resistance to harsh environmental conditions. It is primarily used for construction applications, including glazing, flooring, and kitchen and sanitary sealing. Unlike other marine sealants, polysulfide should not be used for bedding plastic windshields or portlights made of acrylic (Plexiglas) or polycarbonate (Lexan), as it can cause damage to these materials.</span></p><p>The sealant is highly durable and offers exceptional chemical resistance, making it ideal for applications requiring long-term performance and weather resistance. Polysulfide sealants are available in moisture-cured and heat-cured variants, catering to different application requirements.</p><p><strong>The global Polysulfide Construction Sealant market was valued at USD 212 million in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 363.33 million by 2030, reflecting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 8.00% during the forecast period.</strong></p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/287343/global-polysulfide-construction-sealant-forecast-market-2025-2032-244">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/287343/global-polysulfide-construction-sealant-forecast-market-2025-2032-244</a></b></div><p>Regionally, <strong>North America accounted for USD 55.24 million in 2023</strong>, with an expected <strong>CAGR</strong> of <strong>6.86%</strong> from 2025 to 2030.
