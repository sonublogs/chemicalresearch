<h1>PU-based Reactive Hot Melt Adhesives Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>PU-based reactive hot melt adhesive is a specialized adhesive formulation known for its superior bonding properties. Unlike conventional hot melt adhesives that rely on cooling to solidify, PU-based reactive hot melts undergo a chemical curing process. This involves polymerization and cross-linking reactions triggered by environmental factors such as moisture or heat, leading to high-performance adhesive bonds. These adhesives are widely used in industries including automotive, packaging, textiles, electronics, and construction due to their superior flexibility, durability, and resistance to moisture and chemicals.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>The global PU-based Reactive Hot Melt Adhesives market was valued at USD 740 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 1227.70 million by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 7.50% during the forecast period. </strong>North America held a significant market share, with a valuation of <strong>USD 192.82 million in 2023</strong>, expected to grow at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 6.43%</strong> between 2025 and 2032.
