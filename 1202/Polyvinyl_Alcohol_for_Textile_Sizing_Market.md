<h1>Polyvinyl Alcohol for Textile Sizing Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) is widely used as a sizing agent in the textile industry, particularly for synthetic fibers and their blends. Its water solubility and strong adhesive properties make it a preferred choice for improving yarn strength, reducing hairiness, and enhancing weaving efficiency. However, PVA does not degrade easily, contributing significantly to pollution in textile effluent treatment plants.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global Polyvinyl Alcohol for Textile Sizing market was valued at USD 480 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 504.02 million by 2032, exhibiting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 0.70% during the forecast period. The market growth is driven by increasing demand from the textile industry, particularly in emerging economies, and advancements in environmentally friendly sizing alternatives.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The North American Polyvinyl Alcohol for Textile Sizing market was valued at USD 125.07 million in 2023. The region is expected to grow at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 0.60% between 2025 and 2032. The growth is attributed to increasing textile production, rising investments in sustainable textile processing, and stringent regulations regarding effluent treatment.</span></p>
