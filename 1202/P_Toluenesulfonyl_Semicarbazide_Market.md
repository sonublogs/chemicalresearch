 <p><span style="font-size:14px">P-Toluenesulfonyl Semicarbazide (CAS 10396-10-8) is a white crystalline powder that is widely used in various industrial applications, especially in the foaming of plastics such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and synthetic rubbers. With the chemical formula C8H11N3O3S, this compound is known for its efficient foaming properties, which are integral in manufacturing lightweight, durable materials. The use of P-Toluenesulfonyl Semicarbazide in the plastics industry has gained prominence due to its role as a blowing agent, helping create the foam structure necessary for many consumer and industrial products.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px">This chemical compound primarily functions as a foaming agent, creating a gas when heated or decomposed. This gas is trapped within the polymer matrix, resulting in a foamed, lightweight material. The foaming agent&#39;s influence extends to various applications, including but not limited to, packaging materials, automotive parts, and construction materials, where foamed plastics are valued for their lightweight, insulation, and durability characteristics.</span></p>
