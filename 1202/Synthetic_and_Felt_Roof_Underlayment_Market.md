<h1>Synthetic and Felt Roof Underlayment Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:13px">Roofing underlayment refers to the protective layer installed directly on the roof deck, acting as a barrier between the shingles and the sheathing. It is an essential component of the roofing system, offering a secondary line of defense against environmental elements such as rain, snow, and wind. The two primary types of roofing underlayment are </span><strong style="font-size:13px">synthetic underlayment</strong><span style="font-size:13px"> and </span><strong style="font-size:13px">felt underlayment</strong><span style="font-size:13px">, each with unique characteristics that cater to different roofing requirements.</span></p><p>Synthetic underlayment, made from polyethylene or polypropylene, is known for its durability, lightweight nature, and resistance to moisture. Felt underlayment, typically composed of asphalt-saturated paper or fiberglass, has been a traditional choice in the industry due to its affordability and ease of installation.</p><p><strong>The global Synthetic and Felt Roof Underlayment market has shown significant growth, with an estimated valuation of USD 30,840 million in 2023. Projections indicate this market will reach approximately USD 50,173.90 million by 2030, driven by a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 7.20% during the forecast period.</strong></p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/286425/global-synthetic-felt-roof-underlayment-market-2025-2032-293">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/286425/global-synthetic-felt-roof-underlayment-market-2025-2032-293</a></b></div><p>In North America, the market size was valued at <strong>USD 8,036.02 million in 2023</strong>, and it is expected to grow at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of <strong>6.17%</strong> from 2025 to 2030.
