<h1>Latin America Di-Ammonium Phosphate Market Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) is a widely used phosphate fertilizer composed of two primary nutrients: nitrogen and phosphorus. It plays a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity by promoting plant root development, improving crop yield, and supporting soil fertility. The chemical formula for DAP is (NH4)2HPO4, making it a highly soluble and efficient nutrient source. Beyond agriculture, DAP is also utilized in various industrial applications, including fire retardants, brewing, and metal finishing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">The Latin America Di-Ammonium Phosphate market was valued at <strong>US$ 885 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 1.14 billion by 2030</strong>, registering a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.3%</strong> during the forecast period (2024-2030). The growing demand for high-yield crop production and increasing adoption of advanced fertilizers in agricultural economies such as Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico are the primary drivers of market expansion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">Historical data indicates a steady increase in DAP consumption, largely driven by government initiatives promoting sustainable farming and improved fertilizer efficiency.
