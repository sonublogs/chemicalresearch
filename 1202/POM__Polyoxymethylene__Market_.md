<h1>POM (Polyoxymethylene) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Polyoxymethylene (POM), commonly referred to as acetal or polyacetal, is an advanced engineering thermoplastic used in high-performance applications across various industries. It is known for its exceptional mechanical properties, which include high stiffness, low friction, and superior wear resistance. These characteristics make POM ideal for manufacturing precision parts such as gears, bearings, and other mechanical components that operate under high load conditions. The material is available in two primary forms: POM homopolymer (POM-H) and POM copolymer (POM-C), each with distinct characteristics suitable for specific applications.</p><p>POM is characterized by excellent dimensional stability, a wide operating temperature range, and its ability to withstand harsh conditions without significant degradation. Due to these properties, it is used extensively in industries such as automotive, machinery manufacturing, medical devices, and electrical engineering. POM is also known for its high resistance to chemical attack, which makes it suitable for demanding environments where other materials may fail.</p><p><strong>The global POM market was valued at USD 4112.30 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 4723.74 million by 2030. This represents a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 2.00% during the forecast period.</strong> The market???s steady growth can be attributed to the increasing demand for durable, lightweight materials in high-performance applications across multiple sectors.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/287260/global-pom-forecast-market-2025-2032-285">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/287260/global-pom-forecast-market-2025-2032-285</a></b></div><p>In the automotive industry, POM???s ability to replace metal in certain components due to its high strength-to-weight ratio has fueled demand.
