<h1>BDO-PTMEG-Spandex Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMEG), also known as polytetrahydrofuran, is a homopolymer obtained through the cationic ring-opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran (THF) in the presence of a catalyst. It is a primary hydroxyl-terminated linear polyether diol, which exists as a white waxy solid at room temperature and melts into a clear, colorless liquid above room temperature. PTMEG is widely used in various applications due to its excellent solubility in alcohols, esters, ketones, aromatics, and chlorinated hydrocarbons, although it is insoluble in ester-like hydrocarbons and water.</p><p>BDO (1,4-butanediol) is an essential chemical precursor used in the production of PTMEG. It is a colorless oil with low volatility that solidifies at temperatures below 25??C. Spandex, a highly elastic fiber derived from polyurethane, consists of multiple filaments, typically 10D/root, although newer variants reach 15D/root or even 20D/root. The smaller the number, the better the evenness of the fiber, leading to reduced chances of overlap and dryness.</p><p><strong>The global BDO-PTMEG-Spandex market was valued at approximately USD 3,977.30 million in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 5,596.46 million by 2030, representing a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.00% during the forecast period.</strong></p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of
