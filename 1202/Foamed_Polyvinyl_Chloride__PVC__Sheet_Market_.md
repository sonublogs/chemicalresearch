<h1>Foamed Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Sheet Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:13px">Foamed Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Sheet, commonly referred to as PVC foam board, is a synthetic material that is lightweight, durable, and versatile. It is produced by expanding a PVC compound with the help of a blowing agent to create a foam structure. The resulting material has excellent fire resistance, moisture resistance, weather resistance, impact resistance, and high strength-to-weight ratio. PVC foam boards are primarily used in applications that require both durability and insulation, such as partitioning in interiors, soundproofing, and as fire-resistant materials.</span></p><p>The characteristics of PVC foam board make it ideal for use in a wide range of industries, including construction, furniture, advertising, and more. Additionally, it has grown popular as an alternative to traditional materials like wood and metal in some applications due to its non-corrosive properties and ease of maintenance.</p><p><strong>The global Foamed Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Sheet market is estimated to have reached a size of USD 1,154 million in 2023. It is projected to grow significantly, reaching USD 1,735.19 million by 2030, reflecting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 6.00% during the forecast period.</strong> This steady growth is attributed to increasing demand from industries such as construction, soundproofing, refrigeration, and interior decoration, where PVC foam boards are being used to enhance both performance and aesthetic appeal.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/287275/global-foamed-polyvinyl-chloride-sheet-forecast-market-2025-2032-50">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/287275/global-foamed-polyvinyl-chloride-sheet-forecast-market-2025-2032-50</a></b></div><p>Regionally, North America leads the market with a size of USD 300.70 million in 2023 and is expected to continue its growth trajectory with a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.14% through 2030.
