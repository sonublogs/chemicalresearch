<h1>Sialic Acid Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:14px">Sialic acid is a collective term for derivatives of neuraminic acid, a nine-carbon monosaccharide. It is most commonly represented by N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or NANA). Found abundantly in animal tissues and more sparsely in plants, fungi, yeasts, and bacteria, sialic acids play essential roles in biological processes. These acids are predominantly present in glycoproteins and gangliosides, impacting cellular signaling, adhesion, and immune response. Swedish biochemist Gunnar Blix introduced the term "sialic acid" in 1952, derived from the Greek word for saliva (<strong>sialon</strong>).</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14px">Sialic acid's versatile chemical structure allows for modifications such as acetylation, lactylation, methylation, sulfation, and phosphorylation, contributing to its diverse biological functions and industrial applications.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>The global Sialic Acid market was valued at USD 486 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 806.30 million by 2030, registering a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 7.50% during the forecast period.</strong></span></p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/286166/global-sialic-acid-market-2025-2032-688">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/286166/global-sialic-acid-market-2025-2032-688</a></b></div><p><span style="font-size:14px">The market's growth trajectory has been shaped by increasing applications in pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics.
