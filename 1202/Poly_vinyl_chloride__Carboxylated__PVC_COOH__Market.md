<h1>Poly(vinyl chloride) Carboxylated (PVC-COOH) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Poly(vinyl chloride) Carboxylated (PVC-COOH) is a specialized form of PVC that incorporates carboxyl groups (-COOH) into the polymer structure. This modification enhances several crucial properties of the polymer, including corrosion resistance, heat resistance, solubility, flame retardancy, and mechanical strength. These improvements make PVC-COOH suitable for applications in a wide variety of industries, including ultrafiltration membrane preparation and laboratory usage.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">PVC-COOH is primarily used in scenarios requiring higher performance materials that can withstand harsh chemical environments, extreme temperatures, or fire hazards. Its unique properties enable it to function in demanding applications, distinguishing it from regular PVC, which lacks the enhanced functional groups that are key to the added performance.</span></p>
