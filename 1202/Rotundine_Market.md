<h1>Rotundine Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:13px">Rotundine, an active alkaloid compound, is a natural analgesic drug derived from traditional Chinese medicine. Known for its pain-relieving and sedative properties, Rotundine is widely used in pharmaceutical formulations to manage various types of pain, including chronic, neuropathic, and inflammatory pain. Recent advancements have allowed Rotundine to be entrapped in PIC polysaccharide granules, enhancing its bioavailability and controlled release, making it more effective in therapeutic applications.</span></p><p>Rotundine has also shown potential benefits in improving sleep quality and reducing anxiety, which contributes to its expanding use in complementary medicine. Its natural origin and efficacy make it a key player in the growing trend toward plant-based pharmaceuticals.</p><p>The global Rotundine market was valued at <strong>USD 122.40 million in 2023</strong> and is projected to grow to <strong>USD 162.16 million by 2030</strong>, exhibiting a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.10%</strong> during the forecast period. This growth is attributed to increasing demand for natural analgesics and advancements in drug delivery systems.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @ <a href="https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/286414/global-rotundine-market-2025-2032-489">https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/286414/global-rotundine-market-2025-2032-489</a></b></div><p>In <strong>North America</strong>, the Rotundine market size was estimated at <strong>USD 31.89 million in 2023</strong>, with a projected <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 3.51%</strong> from 2025 to 2030.
