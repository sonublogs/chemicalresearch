<h1>Cosmetic Grade Poria Cocos Sclerotium Extract Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><strong>Cosmetic Grade Poria Cocos Sclerotium Extract</strong> is a natural and eco-friendly extract derived from the sclerotium of the Poria cocos fungus, commonly known as the "Chinese Mushroom."

It is particularly valued for its ability to enhance skin vitality and protect against environmental stressors, offering a natural solution for anti-aging and skin rejuvenation.</p><p><strong>The global market for Cosmetic Grade Poria Cocos Sclerotium Extract was valued at approximately USD 1.80 million in 2023.
