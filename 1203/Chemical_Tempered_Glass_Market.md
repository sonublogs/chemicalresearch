<h1>Chemical Tempered Glass Market Size, Share, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029</h1><br/><p><strong>The global Chemical Tempered Glass market was valued at US$ million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ million by 2029, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of % during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.</strong></p><p>Chemical Tempered Glass is a type of glass that has increased strength as a result of a post-production chemical process. When broken, it still shatters in long pointed splinters similar to float glass. For this reason, it is not considered a safety glass and must be laminated if a safety glass is required. However, chemically strengthened glass is typically six to eight times the strength of float glass. The most common trademark for this kind of glass is Gorilla glass.</p><p><strong>This report aims to provide a comprehensive presentation of the global market for Chemical Tempered Glass, with both quantitative and qualitative analysis, to help readers develop business/growth strategies, assess the market competitive situation, analyze their position in the current marketplace, and make informed business decisions regarding Chemical Tempered Glass.
