The beads are typically porous, providing a high surface area. The trapping of ions occurs with concomitant releasing of other ions; thus, the process is called ion-exchange. There are multiple types of ion-exchange resin. Most commercial resins are made of polystyrene sulfonate. Ion-exchange resins are widely used in different separation, purification, and decontamination processes. The most common examples are water softening and water purification. In many cases, ion-exchange resins were introduced in such processes as a more flexible alternative to the use of natural or artificial zeolites.</p><p><strong>This report aims to provide a comprehensive presentation of the global market for Water Treatment Ion Exchange Resins, with both quantitative and qualitative analysis, to help readers develop business/growth strategies, assess the market competitive situation, analyze their position in the current marketplace, and make informed business decisions regarding Water Treatment Ion Exchange Resins.
