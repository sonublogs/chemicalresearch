 <p>Ammonium tungstate pentahydrate is a colorless monoclinic prism crystal or powder, soluble in water and decomposed at high temperature. Ammonium tungstate pentahydrate is also a catalyst used in the production of polyethylene. It reacts with hydrochloric acid and molybdenum to generate ammonium tungsten complex, and reacts with hydrogen and oxygen to generate water vapor. The optimal concentration of ammonium tungstate pentahydrate is 2-5% by weight. Ammonium tungstate pentahydrate does not react with zirconia, so it can be used as a catalyst for the production of polyethylene without additional catalyst addition. Ammonium tungstate pentahydrate has been shown to be an effective oxidation catalyst, especially when it is combined with phosphotungstic acid or other chemical oxidizing agents. The reaction mechanism of such catalysts involves particle formation and energy efficiency.</p>
