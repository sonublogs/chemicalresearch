 <p>Glandular ingredients are nutritional sources that are used as dietary supplements to support the functioning of specific glands. Glandular ingredients are processed by lyophilization of certain glands that are derived from animals. They are either prepared in a powder form or as an extract. The glandular ingredients are generally extracted from bovine(cow), porcine(pig) or ovine(sheep) that are range-fed and are inspected by the government for being disease-free. The glandular from animals raised in New Zealand and Australia are considered to be the best glandular ingredients for human consumption by most of the manufacturers as the animal husbandry regulations in these countries are considered the strictest.
