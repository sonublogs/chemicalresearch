 <p>Hydrogel is a material form formed by polymer network absorbing water and swelling. In recent years, researchers have diversified the chemical composition and network topology of hydrogels, and synthesized various functional hydrogel materials, which are rich in stimuli responsiveness (temperature, electric field, pH, etc.) , functionality (such as drug loading, lubrication, anti-fouling, etc.) and mechanical strength and toughness (strong adhesion, impact resistance, etc.), play an irreplaceable role in the fields of intelligent flexible devices, soft robots, etc. At the same time, with the solution of hydrogel strong and tough bonding technology, people have also begun to integrate functional hydrogel coatings with metals, semiconductors and other materials. The various functional properties of the glue are integrated into the material, thereby creating new opportunities for medical devices, smart flexible devices, and more.</p>
