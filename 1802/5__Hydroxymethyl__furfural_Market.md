 <p><span style="color:rgb(43, 45, 45); font-family:roboto,sans-serif; font-size:16px">This report studies the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) (CAS 67-47-0) market. Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), also 5-(hydroxymethyl) furfural, is an organic compound formed by the dehydration of certain sugars. It is a white low-melting solid (although commercial samples are often yellow) which is highly soluble in both water and organic solvents. The molecule consists of a furan ring, containing both aldehyde and alcohol functional groups. HMF can form in sugar-containing food, particularly as a result of heating or cooking and this formation has been the topic of significant study as HMF is regarded as being potentially carcinogenic to humans. Hydroxymethylfurfural is a marker of poor or overlong storage of foods such as honey. It is produced industrially on a modest scale as a carbon-neutral feedstock for the production of fuels and other chemicals.</span></p>
